## :rocket: About the challenge

In this challenge, you must create an application to train what you have learned so far at ReactJS!

Now you must continue to develop the application that will store your portfolio repositories, which you already developed the backend in the last challenge using Node.js.

### Application template

To help you with this challenge, we have created a template for you that you should use as a github template.

The template is available at the following url:**[Access Template](https://github.com/Rocketseat/gostack-template-conceitos-reactjs)**


Now navigate to the created folder and open it in Visual Studio Code, run the command `yarn` in your terminal to install all dependencies and you are ready to start.

### Application features

Now that you have the template cloned, and ready to continue, you must open the file ** src / App.js **, and complete where there is no code with the code to achieve the objectives of each feature.

- ** `List your API repositories` **: You should be able to create a list with the ** title ** field of all repositories that are registered in your API.

- ** `Add a repository to your API` **: You should be able to add a new item to your API via a button with the text ** Add ** and, after creation, you should be able to display the name after registration.

- ** `Remove a repository from your API` **: For each item on your list, you must have a button with the text ** Remove ** that, when clicked, will call a function to remove that item from your list frontend and its API.

### Specification of tests

In each test, you have a brief description of what your application must do in order for the test to pass.

For this challenge we have the following tests:

- ** `should be able to add new repository` **: For this test to pass, your application must allow a repository to be added to your backend and listed on your frontend within a` LI`.

- ** `should be able to remove repository` **: In order for this test to pass, your application must allow that by clicking on the remove button that will be inside the` LI` of the added repository, the item is removed from the list.

## :calendar: Delivery

This challenge must be delivered from the Skylab platform, send the link to the repository where you made your changes. After completing the challenge, making a post on Linkedin and posting the code on Github is a good way to demonstrate your knowledge and efforts to evolve your career for future opportunities.
